# ketomenu
Simple meal planner with shopping list generation

The purpose of this project was to store keto meal ideas along with their consituent ingredients in a database and generate weekly menus.  Creating shopping lists every week became cumbersome, so an additional feature was created to generate a random selection of meals and their ingredients that could be copy+pasted into a shopping list.

Built with React/Material-UI in the front, and Flask and SQLite in the rear.

You can host the front-end on your own domain, and run the python on PythonAnywhere.com pretty easily.
